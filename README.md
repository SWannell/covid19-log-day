# COVID19 cases and deaths by day

- Takes the [Johns Hopkins daily COVID-19 data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
- Filters down to countries above a floor volume of cases
- Plots a small multiples log chart, normalised to start from the days since X cases happened
- Also draws out the UK, and plots the UK death count against tracer lines for different exponential growth rates.
